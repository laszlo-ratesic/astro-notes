## 📖 Developer Journey

📓 This is a long description about everything we want to say about creating this project. This should include process and challenges, as well as a thorough telling of technologies used and lessons learned along the way.

🦟 It should be multiple paragraphs long and should include a relevant emoji before each new paragraph. For example, this paragraph is about bugs.

## 🛠️ Installation
Locate the dropdown menu labeled 'Code' to the left of the About section in the main page of this repository. From there, select your preferred cloning method from HTTPS, SSH, or the GitHub CLI. For this demonstration, we will be using the SSH method. Copy the link and head to your terminal. From the command line you should enter:

    git clone <INSERT_SSH_KEY_HERE>

Replacing the above placeholder with the link copied from GitHub. This will clone the repository into a local directory on your machine. And that's it! Happy Hacking! 🚀

## 👨‍🏫 Usage
This code is strictly for use by astro-cats and their respective litters of kittens, but not their kitten litter, kittens' litters, or kittens' litter's kittens and is only provided as material for study and otherwise double-checking implementation of various server-side and back-end functionality such as but not limited to API routes, express servers, node module exports, and other shenanigans. Any violations of these use cases will see the offender sent through the airlock, relegated to an escape pod that will be sent into deep space to drift along a lonely eternity through the endless cosmos. Screenshots of original mockup are included.
